This README file merely describes this packaging and source layout of
the MetaPost system.  See INSTALL for some installation help, and
CHANGES for recent and not-so-recent improvements to MetaPost.

The source installation package has been created by extracting the
bits and pieces of TeX Live 2008 that are absolutely needed to compile
Metapost in such a way that it can be plugged into an existing
web2c-based installation afterwards. See http://tug.org/texlive/ for more
information.

The executable that is created by the build process is named mpost. 
As is normal in current TeX systems, this executable functions as both
inimp and virmp by means of a command-line switch.

The source for MetaPost is mplib/*.w

Have fun!
