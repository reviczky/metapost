This README file for the MetaPost distribution is public domain.
(As is the MetaPost software, see the end of this file.)

MetaPost is a system for producing graphics developed by John Hobby at
AT&T, based on Donald Knuth's Metafont. The current distribution is
written in Cweb.

- The MetaPost home page is http://tug.org/metapost.

- The <metapost@tug.org> mailing list is for general help and discussion
  of MetaPost; to subscribe, visit http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/metapost.

- MetaPost development is currently hosted at supelec.fr; visit
  https://foundry.supelec.fr/projects/metapost for the current development
  team members, sources, and much else.
  
- Please report bugs and request enhancements either on the
  metapost@tug.org list, or through Sarovar.  (Please do not send
  reports directly to Dr. Hobby any more.)

This README file merely describes this packaging and source layout of
the MetaPost system.  See ./INSTALL for some installation help, and
./CHANGES for recent and not-so-recent improvements to MetaPost.

The source installation package has been created by extracting the
bits and pieces of TeX Live 2007 that are absolutely needed to compile
the programs in such a way that they can be plugged into an existing
web2c-based installation afterwards. It follows, that for a succesful
build, your system has to be able to compile and install a web2c based
distribution like tetex or TeX Live. See http://tug.org/texlive/ for more
information.

The executable that is created by the build process is named newmpost. 
As is normal in current web2c systems, this executable functions as both
inimp and virmp by means of a command-line switch.

When newmpost is processing an input file that contains TeX commands, 
it depends on a shell script (mpware/makempx) to create an auxiliary
input file that gives corresponding MetaPost picture expressions.

The source for MetaPost is mplib/lib/*.w and lib/mpost.w

Have fun!
