INSTALL for the MPlib beta software on windows
========================

This distribution is a very stripped-down TeX Live distribution, and 
the executable has been built from the sources using the MSYS Unix 
emulation layer.

A side-effect of this is that you a functional web2c-tex distribution 
(like fptex or texlive) is a prerequisite.  Our current executable
will not work with MiKTeX, sorry.
