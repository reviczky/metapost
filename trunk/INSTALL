INSTALL for MPlib releases
========================

NOTE: This is still beta software. Use at your own risk!

This distribution is partially a subset of the TeX Live distribution,
hence the peculiar directory layout.

All source code is in the directory src; the script build.sh will 
generate and populate a directory named build, the script build.cross 
will generate and populate a directory named build-win (this assumes
you are on linux and have a cross-compiling mingw32 installed). 

For cross-compilation, you hvae to make sure you have access to the
command "ctangle" from the commandline, and if not install it
(e.g. from TEXLIVE).

If it succeeds, you will end up with the executable "mpost" in
build/texk/web2c/mpdir. If it doesn't, feel free to email questions
to mp-implementors@tug.org. To install, simply copy the executable
to somewhere in your path. 

For now, the executable still contains a statically linked libmplib.

See CHANGES for a rundown of differences between this release and 
previous releases.
