INSTALL for the MPlib alpha software on windows
========================

This distribution is a very stripped-down TeX Live distribution, and 
the executables have been built from the sources using the MSYS
Unix emulation layer.

A side-effect of this is that you need a functional web2c-tex 
distribution (like fptex) as a prerequisite.  Our current executable
will not work with MiKTeX, sorry.
