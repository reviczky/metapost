INSTALL for MPlib alpha releases
========================

NOTE: This is alpha software. Use at your own risk!

This distribution is partially a subset of the TeX Live distribution,
hence the peculiar directory layout.

All source code is in the directory src; the script build.sh will 
generate and populate a directory named build, the script build.cross 
will generate and populate a directory named build-win (this assumes
you are on linux and have a cross-compiling mingw32 installed). 

Make sure you have access to the command "ctangle" from the
commandline, and install it (e.g. from TEXLIVE) if necessary. Then
try to run the script build.sh from this top-level directory. 

If it succeeds, you will end up with the executable "mpost" in
build/texk/web2c/mpdir. If it doesn't, feel free to email questions
to mp-implementors@tug.org. To install, simply copy the executable
to somewhere in your path. 

For now, the executable still contains a statically linked libmplib.

See CHANGES for a short rundown of differences between this release
and the last pascal-based release.
