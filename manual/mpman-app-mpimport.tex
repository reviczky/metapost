\section{Importing MetaPost Graphics into Third-Party Applications}
\label{mpimport}

MetaPost is very well suited for creating graphics that are to be
included into third-party applications, such as text documents,
presentations or web pages, because MetaPost outputs graphics in vector
formats, which can be scaled without quality degradation.  However,
practice shows, that vector graphics, too, are best created with a rough
target size already in mind.  Scaling a vector graphic calls for
non-proportional scaling of certain technical parameters, such as line
width, arrow size or fonts.  Otherwise, with growing scale factors
scalable graphics tend to change their visual character.  Additionally,
during import into a main document, they'll likely fail to match, e.g.,
stroke width of the document.  To circumvent this, it is advisable to
apply only small post-processing scale factors to vector graphics.  The
following sections briefly discuss how to import MetaPost graphics into
documents with selected applications.

\subsection{\TeX\ and Friends}
\label{teximport}
\index{TeX?\TeX!and friends}

MetaPost graphics in the PostScript\index{PostScript} format can be
easily integrated into documents prepared with \TeX\ and friends.
MetaPost's PostScript output is a low-featured dialect of the Postscript
language, called \emph{purified EPS}\index{EPS!purified}, which can be
converted into the Portable Document Format (PDF\index{PDF}) language
on-the-fly.  For that reason, external MetaPost graphics can be used on
both routes: a) using the traditional \TeX\ engine together with an
external PostScript output driver and b) using newer \TeX\ engines, like
pdf\TeX\ or its successor Lua\TeX, which contain a built-in PDF output
driver.  Lua\TeX\ can additionally process embedded MetaPost code
natively, falling back to the built-in \emph{mplib} library.

Figure~\ref{fig:teximport} shows the process of including an external
MetaPost graphic into a \TeX\ document using the PostScript route.  In
the \TeX\ source a ``magic macro'' provided by the format or an external
package is used for including a graphic file.  During the typesetting
stage, the macro only reads bounding box information off the PostScript
file and reserves the required space on the page via an empty box.  The
file reference is passed-on to the output driver and only then, finally,
the file is embedded into the document.  The freely available program
\ttindex{dvips} is used as an output driver in this
example.\footnote{The C source for \ttt{dvips} comes with the web2c
  \TeX\ distribution.  Similar programs are available from other
  sources.}  The next paragraphs give more detailed information on some
popular combinations of \TeX\ formats and engines.

$$ \includegraphics{mpman-charts-1.mps} $$

  MetaPost figures}

\subsubsection{Plain \TeX\ Format}
\label{plaintexformat}
\index{TeX?\TeX!format, plain!importing MetaPost files}

For users of the Plain \TeX\ format and the traditional \TeX\
engine\index{TeX?\TeX!engine} with Device Independend output
(DVI\index{dvi file?{\tt dvi} file}) the
\ttt{epsf}\index{epsf.tex?\texttt{epsf.tex}} package provides the
``magic macro''
$$ \verb|\epsfbox{|\descr{filename}\verb|}|%
\index{epsfbox?\texttt{\string\epsfbox}} $$
for embedding graphics, e.g., \verb|\epsfbox{fig.1}|.

Users of the pdf\TeX\ engine\index{pdfTeX?pdf\TeX!engine} should refer
to the standalone macros of the \ttindex{mptopdf} bundle, which can be
found at \url{http://context.aanhet.net/mptopdf.htm}.

With the Lua\TeX\ engine\index{LuaTeX?Lua\TeX!engine}, embedding
external graphics works the same as with pdf\TeX.  Additionally,
Lua\TeX\ users can inline MetaPost code directly into Plain \TeX\
documents.  Lua\TeX\ is able to process such MetaPost code snippets,
falling back to the built-in \emph{mplib}\index{mplib?\emph{mplib}}
library.  Note, \emph{mplib} doesn't support \texttt{verbatimtex/btex
  .. etex} constructs, currently.  Here is an example of a MetaPost
graphic inlined into a Plain \TeX\ document.  For more information,
please refer to the Lua\TeX~\cite[chap.~4.8]{luatex:manual} and
\ttindex{luamplib}~\cite{hagen:luamplib} documentation.

$$\begin{verbatim}
\input luamplib.sty
\mplibcode
beginfig(1);
  ...
endfig;
\endmplibcode
\bye
\end{verbatim}
$$

\subsubsection{\LaTeX\ Format}
\label{latexformat}
\index{LaTeX?\LaTeX!format!importing MetaPost files}
\index{TeX?\TeX!engine}
\index{pdfTeX?pdf\TeX!engine}

For users of the \LaTeX\ format and the traditional \TeX\ engine with
Device Independent output (DVI\index{dvi file?{\tt dvi} file}) the
well-known \ttindex{graphics} (or \ttindex{graphicx}) package aids in
external graphics inclusion.  The package supports different engines,
guessing the correct output driver automatically, and can handle several
graphic formats.  The ``magic macro'' is
$$ \verb|\includegraphics{|\descr{filename}\verb|}|%
\index{includegraphics?\texttt{\string\includegraphics}} $$

In DVI output driver mode the \ttt{graphics} package assumes all files
with an unknown file extension, such as \texttt{.1} etc., to be in the
EPS\index{EPS} format.  It therefore handles MetaPost files with a
numeric default file extension correctly (see~\cite{reckdahl:epslatex}
for more information).

When using the pdf\TeX\ engine with a built-in PDF output driver, the
situation is a bit different.  Only files with file extension
\texttt{.mps}\index{mps file?{\tt mps} file}\index{files!mps?{\tt mps}}
are recognized as purified EPS\index{EPS!purified} and can be converted
to PDF\index{PDF} on-the-fly.  The recommended procedure for embedding
MetaPost graphics into \LaTeX\ documents compiled with pdf\TeX\ is
therefore to change MetaPost's output file name extension via
\verb|outputtemplate|\index{outputtemplate?\texttt{outputtemplate}} (see
p.~\pageref{Doutputtemplate}).  In the \LaTeX\ document include the
graphic files with full name, e.g.,
$$\begin{verbatim}
\includegraphics{fig-1.mps}
\end{verbatim}
$$

Note, the latter approach works with the \ttindex{dvips} driver, too.
Even though, again, this time \ttt{.mps} is an unknown file extension,
triggering EPS file handling in a fall-back procedure.  This property of
the \ttt{graphics} package, which comes in handy for MetaPost files, is
the reason many MetaPost source files start with the line
$$\begin{verbatim}
outputtemplate := "%j-%c.mps";
\end{verbatim}
$$

With the Lua\TeX\ engine\index{LuaTeX?Lua\TeX!engine}, embedding
external graphics works the same as with pdf\TeX.  Additionally,
Lua\TeX\ users can inline MetaPost code directly into La\TeX\ documents.
Lua\TeX\ is able to process such MetaPost code snippets, falling back to
the built-in \emph{mplib}\index{mplib?\emph{mplib}} library.  Note,
\emph{mplib} doesn't support \texttt{verbatimtex/btex .. etex}
constructs, currently.  Here is an example of a MetaPost graphic inlined
into a \LaTeX\ document.  For more information, please refer to the
Lua\TeX~\cite[chap.~4.8]{luatex:manual} and
\ttindex{luamplib}~\cite{hagen:luamplib} documentation.

$$\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{luamplib}
\begin{document}
\begin{mplibcode}
beginfig(1);
  ...
endfig;
\end{mplibcode}
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
$$

\subsubsection{Con\TeX t Format}
\label{contextformat}
\index{ConTeXt?Con\TeX t!format!importing MetaPost files}

In Con\TeX t\index{ConTeXt?Con\TeX t} graphics support is integrated in
the kernel, covering advanced features like shading, transparency, color
spaces or image inclusion.  The ``magic macro'' for embedding external
graphics is
$$ \verb|\externalfigure[|\descr{filename}\verb|]|%
\index{externalfigure?\texttt{\string\externalfigure}} $$
%
The macro can handle numbered files as well as files with the \ttt{mps}
suffix.

Alternatively, Con\TeX t users can inline MetaPost code in the document
source, which allows for more natural interfacing with document
properties, font support, and automatic processing~\cite{hagen:metafun}.
Here is an example of a MetaPost graphic inlined into a Con\TeX t
document.

$$\begin{verbatim}[commandchars=|\[\], codes={\catcode`$=3}]
\starttext
\startuseMPgraphic{$|descr[name]$}
  ...
\stopuseMPgraphic
\useMPgraphic{$|descr[name]$}
\stoptext
\end{verbatim}
$$

Con\TeX t MkIV, being based on the Lua\TeX\ engine, provides a much
tighter integration of MetaPost than older versions, since it can
fall-back to the built-in \emph{mplib}\index{mplib?\emph{mplib}}
library.

\subsection{\emph{troff}}
\label{troffimport}
\index{troff!importing MetaPost files}

It is also possible to include MetaPost output in a GNU \emph{troff}
document.  The procedure is similar to Figure~\ref{fig:teximport}: the
\ttt{grops} output processor includes PostScript files when they are
requested via \emph{troff}'s \ttt{\string\X} command.  The
\ttt{-mpspic}\index{mpspic?\texttt{-mpspic}} macro package provides a
command \verb|.PSPIC|\index{PSPIC?\texttt{.PSPIC}}, which does just that
when including an encapsulated PostScript file in the source code.  For
instance, the \emph{troff} command
$$ \hbox{\verb|.PSPIC fig.1|} $$
includes \ttt{fig.1}, using the natural height and width of the
image as given in the file's bounding box.

\subsection{Handling SVG Files}
\label{svgfiles}
\index{SVG!files}

SVG graphics can be easily embedded into HTML\index{HTML} documents with
the following code snippet:

$$\begin{verbatim}
<p>
  <object data="foo.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="300" height="200">
  </object>
</p>
\end{verbatim}
$$

SVG files can also be imported by various interactive graphics editing
programs, for example GIMP\index{GIMP} or Inkscape\index{Inkscape}.  See
section~\ref{Dprologues} for information on font handling in SVG
graphics.
