This file contains an unsorted list of tasks to be done on the
MetaPost manual.  Feel free to add new, move or remove finished
items.

Where to put new items?
-----------------------
Section 'Wanted For Release' contains items that we want to be
finished before the next release.  Even minor issues can and
should be added here.

Items in section 'Mid Term Issues' have no dead-line, but should
be self-contained enough to be done independent from other stuff.

Items in section 'Long Term Issues' are less actively worked on.
The reason they are less actively worked on is not lack of
importance, but lack of developer resources.  Nevertheless, they
are on the agenda.  Contributions are welcome!

How to pick items?
------------------
You can indicate interest or active work on an item by putting your
initials in parenthese in front of that item and checking the
modified TODO file into the repository.  That way, anybody who is
subscribed to the metapost-commits list is notified of your
interest.  Additionally, it is wise to communicate that you're
working on an issue (you didn't remember adding yourself) on the
mp-implementors list or alternatively the metapost list.
