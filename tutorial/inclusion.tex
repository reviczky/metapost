\begin{section}{Including \MP{} figures in \LaTeX}
In order to include a \MP{} figure in \LaTeX{}, the \texttt{graphicx} package is suggested.  Below is an example of including a \MP{} figure (with name \texttt{foo.1}) in a \LaTeX{} document.
\begin{lstlisting}[xleftmargin=17bp]
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{ifpdf}
\ifpdf
   \DeclareGraphicsRule{*}{mps}{*}{}
\fi
\begin{document}
|\dots|
\includegraphics{foo.1}
|\dots|
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}
The \texttt{ifpdf} package and \verb|\ifpdf|\texttt{\dots}\verb|\fi| command is used to prompt \PDF\LaTeX{} to convert the \MP{} graphic to \PDF\ ``on the fly'' using Hans Hagen's \texttt{mptopdf}.  This conversion is necessary since \PDF\LaTeX{} performs no \PS{} processing.
