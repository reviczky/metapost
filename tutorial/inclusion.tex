\begin{section}{Including \MP{} figures in \LaTeX}
In order to include a \MP{} figure in \LaTeX{}, the \texttt{graphicx} package is suggested.  Below is an example of including a \MP{} figure (with name \texttt{foo-1.mps}) in a \LaTeX{} document.
\begin{lstlisting}[xleftmargin=17bp]
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
|\dots|
\includegraphics{foo-1.mps}
|\dots|
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}
Having a \verb|.mps| file extension on the graphic allows the same graphic to be included in both \LaTeX{} and \PDF\LaTeX{} documents.  When using \PDF\LaTeX, the EPS graphic (with file extension \verb|.mps|) is converted to \PDF{} ``on the fly'' using Hans Hagen's \texttt{mptopdf}.  This conversion is necessary since \PDF\LaTeX{} performs no \PS{} processing.
