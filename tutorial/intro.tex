\begin{section}{Introduction}
\addtocounter{footnote}{1}\footnotetext{All graphics in this article (except Figure \ref{fig:previewer}) are created with \MP{}, and the source code and any required external data files for each of these graphics are embedded as file attachments in the electronic \PDF{} version of the article.}To accompany \TeX{}, Knuth developed \MF{} as a method of ``creating entire families of fonts from a set of dimensional parameters and outline descriptions''~\cite{beebe:mf}.  Approximately ten years later, John Hobby began work on \MP{}\Dash ``a powerful graphics language based on Knuth's \MF, but with PostScript output and facilities for including typeset text''~\cite{hobby:user}.  Although several packages (e.g., \PiC\TeX, \Xy-pic, and the native \LaTeX{} picture environment to name a few) are available for creating graphics within \TeX-based documents, they all rely on \TeX{}.  Since \TeX{} was designed to typeset text, it seems natural that an external utility should be used to generate graphics instead.  Furthermore, in the event that the graphics require typeset text, then the utility should use \TeX{} for this requirement.  This premise is exactly the philosophy of \MP.

Since \MP{} is a programming language, it accommodates data structures and flow control, and compilation of the \MP{} source code yields \EPS{} graphics.  These features provide an elegant method for generating graphics.  Figure~\ref{fig:circles} illustrates how \MP{} can be used programatically.  The figure is generated by rotating one of the circles multiple times to obtain the desired \textit{circular chain}.

\end{figure} 
The programming language constructs of \MP{} also deliver a graceful mechanism for creating animations without having to manually create each frame of the animation.  The primary advantage of \EPS{} is that it can be scaled to any resolution without a loss in quality.  It can also be easily converted to raster formats, e.g.\ Portable Network Graphics (\PNG) and Joint Photographic Experts Group (\JPEG), et al., or other vector formats including Portable Document Format (\PDF) and Scalable Vector Graphics (\SVG), et al.
