INSTALL for metapost
========================

This distribution is a (very!) stripped-down version of the TeX Live
distribution.  All source code is in the directory src; the script Build
will generate and populate a directory named build.

Try the script Build from this top-level directory. If it succeeds, you
should end up with the executable files mpost and dvitomp in
build/texk/web2c along with the pool file mp.pool.

There will also be four executables named dmp, mpto, newer, and makempx in 
the directory build/texk/web2c/mpware

Replace all these files in your TeX installation by the new ones, and
regenerate any .mem files in your TeX installation.

The directory texmf contains the standard (mplib) include files,
and the optional support files for troff are in troff. These need to
be copied to a location where your installation can find them at
runtime.

The manual sources are included in the directory manual.  PDFs are
available at:
http://cvs.sarovar.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/doc/?cvsroot=metapost

If all else fails, follow the clues in README, src/texk/INSTALL and
src/texk/web2c/INSTALL.
