INSTALL for MPlib releases
========================

This distribution is partially a subset of the TeX Live distribution,
hence the peculiar directory layout.

All source code is in the directory source; the script build.sh will 
generate and populate a directory named build, or build-windows
when called with --mingw (this assumes you are on linux and have a 
cross-compiling mingw32 installed) or ppc when called with --pc
(this assumes you are on intel MacOSX coss-compiling for powerpc). 

For cross-compilation, you have to make sure you have access to the
command "ctangle" from the commandline, and if not install it
(e.g. from TEXLIVE).

If the build succeeds, you will end up with the executable "mpost" or
in <builddir>/texk/web2c. If it doesn't, feel free to email questions
to mp-implementors@tug.org. To install, simply copy the executable
to somewhere in your path. 

For now, the executable still contains a statically linked libmplib.

See CHANGES for a rundown of differences between this release and 
previous releases.
